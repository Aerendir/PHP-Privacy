# PHP-Privacy
A component to implement privacy by design in your PHP project.

This component follows a discussion on [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony) in [#26231](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/26231).

EU Law
------

To ease the development consequences of the privacy regulations and directives, **we provide a condesed version of the GDPR regulation and of the Privacy Cookie Directive**.

Those two documents are the same as the ones provided by the EU but without all the *legalese*.

Also if **they not make the law** (the Law always is the one you can find in the official documents of the EU), they are **useful tools to understand which are the implications** on our lives as developers and **on our apps as wrote following the "Privacy by Design" principles**.

Here's the list of available documents:

- [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](EU-law/GDPR-for-devs.md).
